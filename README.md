---------------------------------------------------------------
Designing a n-puzzle game, with parity checker, solve button, and random/new game button.


TO DO

add a solver in the background that adds moves to a stack that will display on the screen
or else we can have all moves on the screen be displayed
add random blank spot and then where the blank spot falls whether even or odd
HIGH PRIORITY make sure input works for all sizes
add a better shuffler that actually works probably will use Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm

a technique to solving is to move each piece into the correct spot
int lexographic order.

Double check Solvability function later
